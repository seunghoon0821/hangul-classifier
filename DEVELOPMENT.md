	- Created elementary drawing tool.
- **11/23/19**
	- Fixed bug with clear button.
	- Cleaned up code regarding the drawing brush size.
	- Began searching for all 100 korean .ttf fonts.
- **11/28/19**
	- Found all 100 korean .ttf fonts to use.
	- Started to figure out how to add text to images and save them.
- **11/29/19**
	- Continued to explore adding text to images and centering them.
- **11/30/19**
	- Created method to iterate through korean fonts to be able to create images looping through them.
- **12/03/19**
	- Able to take in ofImage of the drawn text by the user in the GUI.
	- Created sub directory for images to be saved into for better organization.
	- Attempted to figure out how to show text in Korean as cv.putText would only allow for English.
- **12/04/19**
	- Further attempted program's ability to display Korean text.
	- Changed thickness of the brush to match thickness of the fonts.
- **12/05/19**
	- Figured out how to write TTF text in Korean into an ofImage and save it, allowing for the creation of a testing set.
	- Deskewed Korean alphabet images with ofxOpenCv.
- **12/07/19 - 12/09/19**
	- Continuously attempted to figure out how to center text, to no avail.
	- Started working on Naive Bayes classifier.
- **12/10/19**
	- Figured out how to center text using contours and created method that centers it in the image.
	- Changed image into binary vector to be used in the classifier.
	- Recreated 2400 training images (took 6 hours).
- **12/11/19**
	- Finished working on the classifier.
	- Edited directory iterator that did not follow the order of the images in the directory by name.
	- Allowed ofImage that was previously collected by analyze to be shifted into the binary string vector that is used by the classifier.
	- Created testing set and labels which resulted in a 79.166% accuracy rate.
	- Added Catch2 and minimal tests in project.
	- Streamlined and commented out code.
